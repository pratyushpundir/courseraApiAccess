# Coursera API Data Access and Export
Uses Laravel 5.2.15 to access the Coursera API and persist data to a MySQL DB. Also provides ability to export the persisted data to Excel files.

# Record Types
 - Courses
 - Partners
 - Instructors

# ToDo
 - Abstract a lot of stuff currently in the controller to make them usable for EdX, Udacity and may be more providers.
 - Provide a proper frontend rather than the ugly stuff this has right now as an excuse.
